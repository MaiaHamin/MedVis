California v.Chevron is a civil action brought by the city attorneys of San Francisco and Oakland, who accuse the defendants of creating a “public nuisance” by contributing to climate change and of conspiring to cover it up so they could continue to profit.  The hearing did mark a shift toward accountability—but perhaps not in the way activists would have liked, writes Phelim McAleer.",
